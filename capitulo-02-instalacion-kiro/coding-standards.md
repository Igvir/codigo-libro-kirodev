# Coding Standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for React components and classes
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## React Patterns
- Always use functional components with hooks
- Separate business logic in custom hooks
- Use CSS Modules, never inline styles
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript types

## Error Handling
- Always use try-catch for async operations
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors to console in development

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all hooks
- Write integration tests for user flows
- Aim for >80% coverage
